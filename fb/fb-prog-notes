recurison rules: Better to return some value than void - NULL, current-node, value;

BST:
is BST : node key value check between min and max; (node < min || node > max) is false. reset max for left-tree, reset min for right-tree
size: null = 0; 1+size(left)+size(right)
max depth / height:  null = 0;  height(l)<height(r)? r+1: l+1
in-order: node(left); node; node(right)
post-order: node(right); node; node(left)
pre-order: node; node(left); node(right)
min-value: far-left holds min key; while(node->left) node->key;
max-value: far-right holds max key; while(node->right) node-key;
all-paths:
longest-path:
shortest-path:
bfs: 
nchild-node: child for each node;
invert-tree; mirror tree;
